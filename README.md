Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Machine Learning projects that I've embarked on, all created without the formal education of a degree. As someone passionate about the field of AI and ML, I decided to take the plunge into this exciting world, fueled by my curiosity and a desire to learn. These projects represent my journey, starting from scratch and gradually building my skills and knowledge in the realm of Machine Learning.

Projects Overview
In this repository, you'll discover a series of projects that range from simple, introductory exercises to more complex, real-world applications. Each project serves as a testament to my dedication and perseverance in this self-taught endeavor. While I may not have a formal degree, I believe that passion, determination, and continuous learning can bridge any gap.

Learning Process
Throughout my journey, I have relied on online courses, tutorials, textbooks, and the generous support of the open-source community. These projects are a reflection of the skills and insights I've gained along the way. I've made mistakes, faced challenges, and celebrated small victories, all of which have contributed to my growth as a Machine Learning enthusiast.
